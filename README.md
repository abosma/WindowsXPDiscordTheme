Changes Discord to a Windows XP/MSN Messenger Theme.

#### How to install the theme
Here's a good tutorial for installing BD Themes https://codepen.io/Beard-Design/full/mEXNaN

You can download the theme from https://github.com/abosma/WindowsXPDiscordTheme/releases/download/1.0/windowsxp.theme.css

Currently only works if you have normalized classes enabled, WIP
